SYNOPSIS
       ssdeep [-m &lt;file&gt;] [-k &lt;file&gt;] [-vdprgsblcxa] [-t val] [FILES]
       ssdeep [-V|h]


DESCRIPTION
       Computes a signature based on context triggered piecewise hashes for each input file, also called a fuzzy hash.  If requested, the program matches
       those signatures against a file of known signatures and reports any possible matches.  It can also examine one or more  files  of  signatures  and
       find any matches in those files.  Output is written to standard out and errors to standard error.


       -m &lt;file&gt;
              Loads  the  specified  file  of  known hashes to be used for matching. This file must be a previous output of the program. The program then
              hashes each entry in FILES and compares these signatures to the known signatures.  Any matches which score above  the  threshold  are  dis‐
              played.  This flag may be used multiple times to load more known signatures.  This flag may not be used with the -k or -x flags.


       -k &lt;file&gt;
              Load  the  specified  file  of  known  hashes to be used for matching. This file must be a previous output of the program. The program then
              treats each entry in FILES as a set of known hashes as well. The hashes in these FILES are compared to the known  hashes  from  this  file.
              Matches  which score above the threshold are displayed. Both the file specified here and the input FILES should contain fuzzy hashes.  This
              flag may be used multiple times to load more known signatures.  This flag may not be used with the -m, -d, or -p flags.


       -v     Verbose mode. The name of each file is printed to standard error as it is being hashed.


       -d     Computes a signature for each entry in the FILES and compares it to the set of known signatures. Matches which score  above  the  threshold
              are displayed. The computed signature is then added to the set of known signatures.  This flag may not be used with the -k or -x flags.


       -p     Works  like the -d flag, but displays all matches for each file. That is, for two files A and B which match score above the threshold, dis‐
              plays "A matches B" and "B matches A".  This flag may not be used with the -k or -x flags.


       -r     Enables recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed.  Please note that recursive mode cannot be used to examine all files of  a  given
              file  extension.  For  example,  invoking the program with -r *.txt will examine all files in directories that end in .txt.  If you want to
              process all files in a directory tree with the .txt suffix, try using the <B>find(1)</B> command.


       -g     Similar files are grouped together into clusters. This can be handy for finding more similar files. That is, if you are searching for  file
              A, which matches B, anything which matches B will also be included in the cluster.


       -s     Silent mode. All error messages are suppressed.


       -b     Enables bare mode. Strips any leading directory information from displayed filenames.  This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -l
              flag.


              zero.


       -t &lt;val&gt;
              In any of the matching modes, only display matches when match score is greater than the given value. The default threshold value is zero.


       -h     Show a help screen and exit.


       -V     Show the version number and exit.



RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, 1 if there is a problem.  Read errors, permission denied, and encountering directories while not in recursive mode are still
       considered successes. Problems are things like being unable to load the matching file, specifying both bare and relative paths, etc.
