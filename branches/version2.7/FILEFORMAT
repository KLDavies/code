SSDEEP FILE FORMAT VERSION 1.2

1. REVISION HISTORY

14 Aug 2006 - Initial version (jk)
15 Jul 2010 - Adding quotation marks to filenames, bump to version 1.1
 1 Feb 2011 - Adding optional third hash, bump to version 1.2


2. FILE HEADER

The first line of the file is a header, like this:

ssdeep,1.2--blocksize:hash:hash[:hash],filename

ssdeep - Identifies the file type
1.2    - The version of the file format, NOT the version of the program
--     - Separator

The remainder of the line identifies the format of the file. 
Note that for version 1.2 these values must be given EXACTLY as shown above


3. FILE DATA

Each line represents the hash of one file as listed in the header. 
Specifically, we have the blocksize used by the program, the hash for 
this blocksize, the hash for twice the blocksize, and, optionally, the 
hash for three times the block size. The line ends with the filename. 
Filenames are enclosed in quotation marks. Filenames which contain a 
quotation mark will have those quotes slash escaped. For example, the 
file ma"in.c will be listed as:

"ma\"in.c"
