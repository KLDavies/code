	* Removed block_size value from state variable. 
	  Nobody was using it.

	* Appended API functions to hash file or buffer.

	* Moved ssdeep code into engine.c, moved fuzzy hashing
	  code into fuzzy.c. This will help us create libfuzzy
	  and fuzzy.dll.

	* Lots of cleanup to fuzzy hashing code. This includes removing
	  types like 'uchar' and replacing them with C99 types like
	  unsigned char. Less work for mother means less work debugging.
