SSDEEP INSTALLATION GUIDE


** Microsoft Windows

The easiest way to install ssdeep is to download one of the pre-compiled
binaries available at http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net/. If you want to 
compile the program yourself, understand that the source code was
intended to be compiled using gcc, specifically being cross-compiled
from Linux or OS X to Win32. You can download gcc for Windows and
compile the program on a Windows system, but this method is not supported.
Both MinGW and Cygwin are gcc compilers for Windows. 

To cross compile the program, first install a gcc cross compiler 
(See the MinGW FAQ: http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml#faq-cross)
Then update the CR_BASE variable in the Makefile to reflect where your
cross compiler has been installed. Finally, compile the program with:

$ make cross



** Linux

To compile the program:

$ make



** OS X

To compile a generic OS X version of the program:

$ make mac

To compile a version that runs faster on G5 processors (and *only* G5
processors!)

$ make macg5



** BSD, Solaris, and all other OS

To compile the program:

$ make unix





** To install the program:

# make install

Note that you must be root to install the program in the default
location! You can change the installation point by altering the 
PREFIX variable in the Makefile.


** To uninstall the program

# make uninstall
